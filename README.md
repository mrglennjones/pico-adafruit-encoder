Adafruit I2C QT Rotary Encoder Breakout


i've been trying to get these (3 chained) endoders running on the piromoroni pico plus 2w with little success, it can see them i2c devices but then appears to time out.

it cannot read the encoder values or set the neopixel led. but the delta of the button can be read.
